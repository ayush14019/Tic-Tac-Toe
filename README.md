# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
Players take turns clicking on empty squares to place their mark (X or O).
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all squares are filled and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
Enjoy playing!
