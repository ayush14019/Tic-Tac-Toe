# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. Here's a basic description:

Objective:
The objective of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their own marks (either "X" or "O") on the grid.

Gameplay:
The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
Players take turns placing their marks ("X" for the first player and "O" for the second player) in empty cells of the grid.
The first player to successfully align three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has achieved a winning alignment, the game ends in a draw.

Rules:
Players take turns placing their marks on the grid one at a time.
Marks cannot be placed on cells that are already occupied.
The game ends as soon as one player achieves a winning alignment or when the grid is filled with no winner (draw).
The game can be played in multiple rounds, with players taking turns as the first player ("X") in each round.

Strategy:
Players aim to create a winning alignment while simultaneously blocking their opponent from achieving the same.
A common strategy is to prioritize forming lines of two of their own marks, while also blocking potential lines of their opponent's marks.
Since the grid is small and the number of possible moves is limited, experienced players often seek to predict their opponent's moves and plan several moves ahead.

Overall, Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet engaging game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. It's a great way to develop strategic thinking and logical reasoning skills.
